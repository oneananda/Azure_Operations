# Azure NAT Gateway

Azure NAT Gateway - Network Address Translation (NAT) service that provides outbound Internet connectivity for resources in an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) without exposing them to inbound public traffic. It enables virtual machines (VMs), containers, and other resources within a VNet to communicate with external services while maintaining their private IP addresses.

## Key Features

- **Outbound Connectivity:** Using Azure NAT Gateway the resouces present in VNet will make outbound connections via a single public static IP address.
- **Static Public IP Address:** Uses static public IP addresses to route the private IP addresses in the VNet
- **Scalability:** This can scale to large number of concurrent users, making it suitable for large enterprises with high outbound connections
- **High Availablity:** This is a fully managed service, with built-in redundancy ensuring high availablity

## How Azure NAT Gateway Works

**Private IPs and Outbound Traffic:**

- Resources within a VNet, such as VMs, typically have private IP addresses that are not routable on the Internet.
- When these resources need to access external services (e.g., APIs, databases, websites), they require a public IP address to initiate the connection.

**Association with Subnets:**

- We can associate the NAT Gateway with one or more subnets within the VNet.
- Once associated, all outbound traffic from resources within those subnets will be routed through the NAT Gateway.

**Network Address Translation (NAT):**

- The NAT Gateway translates the private IP addresses of your resources to the public IP address(es) associated with the NAT Gateway.
- This translation occurs automatically for all outbound connections.

**Static Public IP:**

- The public IP address used by the NAT Gateway remains static, ensuring consistent outbound connectivity. This is essential for scenarios where the same public IP needs to be maintained, such as when connecting to external services that require IP whitelisting.

## Steps for Azure NAT Gateway

- Create a NAT Gateway:
- Associate with Subnets:
- Configure Network Security Groups (NSGs):

## Use Cases for Azure NAT Gateway

- **High Availability and Scalability:** 
    - Suitable for scenarios requiring high-volume outbound traffic, such as large-scale web applications, microservices architectures, or API gateways.
- **Consistent Outbound IP:** 
    - Useful when we need to maintain a consistent outbound IP address for connecting to external services that use IP whitelisting (e.g., SaaS providers, third-party APIs).
- **Enhanced Security:** 
    - Improves security by preventing inbound traffic to the resources while still allowing outbound communication.
    - Can be used in conjunction with NSGs and Azure Firewall for a comprehensive network security strategy.
