## Notes

- **Inbound Traffic (I):** Services that are typically used to manage or facilitate inbound traffic to Azure resources.
- **Outbound Traffic (O):** Services that are typically used to manage or facilitate outbound traffic from Azure resources.
- **Bidirectional Traffic (I/O):** Services that support both inbound and outbound traffic scenarios.
- **Optionally Yes:** Indicates that the service can be configured to support the traffic type but is not primarily designed for it.
- **Strictly Not Used:** Services that are not designed for a particular traffic direction are marked accordingly.
