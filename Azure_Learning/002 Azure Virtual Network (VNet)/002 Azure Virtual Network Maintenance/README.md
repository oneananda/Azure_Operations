## Maintaining a VNet - Azure Virtual Network Maintenance

Maintaining a VNet involves monitoring, updating, and troubleshooting to ensure optimal performance and security:

### Monitoring

- Use **Azure Monitor** and **Network Watcher** to:
  - Track network traffic.
  - Diagnose connectivity issues.
  - View network performance metrics.

### Updating

- Regularly review and update:
  - **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**.
  - **Route tables**.
  - Other configurations to adapt to changes in your network requirements.

### Scaling

- If needed, adjust:
  - The IP address ranges of your `VNets and subnets`.
  - Add more VNets and `peering connections` to accommodate growth.

### Security

- Periodically review and update:
  - Your security policies, such as `NSG rules and firewall configurations`.
  - Address evolving security threats.

### Troubleshooting

- Use **Azure Network Watcher** tools like:
  - **Connection troubleshoot**.
  - **Packet capture**.
- `Diagnose` and resolve network issues.
