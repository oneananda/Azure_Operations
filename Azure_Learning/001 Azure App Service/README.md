# Azure App Service

## Introduction

`Azure App Service` is a fully managed `Platform as a Service (PaaS)` from `Microsoft` that empowers developers to build, deploy, and scale web applications quickly and efficiently, RESTful APIs, and mobile backends.

Under `Azure App Service`, you can host web apps in `different programming languages` or development frameworks—like .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, and PHP.

### **Advantages:**

- **Managed infrastructure:**  `Azure App Service` manages all infrastructure-related things like
	- Patching
	- Scaling
	- Load Balancing 
	- High Availablity

This enables focusing on building the application rather than worrying about the infrastructure.

- **Scalability:** It has `inbuilt auto-scaling` options, which will enable the application to scale up or down as per demand.

- **Integrated DevOps:** `Azure App Service` provides a seamless experience with `Azure DevOps`, `GitHub`, `Bitbucket`, and other `CI/CD tools for continuous integration and continuous deployment`. It thus optimizes the development lifecycle—from code commit to production.

- **Multi-Language Support:** It `supports a variety of programming languages` and frameworks; hence, it is versatile and flexible enough to operate under very different development environments.

- **Security:** `Azure`, by default, provides a high level of security, and `Azure App Service` inherits these security features, security features such as HTTPS, custom domain support, and integration with `Azure Active Directory` for authentication and authorization, it also supports managed certificates so that we can easily configure the `SSL / TLS` for our apps.

- **Monitoring and Diagnostics:** With integrated tools like `Azure Monitor`, `Appllication Insights` we can monitor the health checks, performance and usage of the applications, these will help us in identifying the issues quickly so that we can resolve quickly.

- **Global Reach:** `Azure App Service` provides the flexiblity to deploy the applications in multiple regions worldwide, so that we can reach out to world wide audiences in minutes via our apps.

- **Cost Effective:** With the option `pay-as-you-go` we can set our usage based on seconds, thus optimize our costs in a effective manner, `Azure App Service` provides multiple budget friendly options to choose.
