# Azure App Service

## Introduction

`Azure App Service` is a fully managed Platform as a Service (PaaS) from Microsoft that empowers developers to build, deploy, and scale web applications quickly and efficiently, RESTful APIs, and mobile backends.

Under Azure App Service, you can host web apps in different programming languages or development frameworks—like .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, and PHP.

### **Advantages:**

- **Managed infrastructure:**

`Azure App Service` manages all infrastructure-related things like
- Patching
- Scaling
- Load Balancing 
- High Availablity

This enables focusing on building the application rather than worrying about the infrastructure.

- **Scalability:**

It has inbuilt auto-scaling options, which will enable the application to scale up or down as per demand.

- **Integrated DevOps:**

Azure App Service provides a seamless experience with Azure DevOps, GitHub, Bitbucket, and other CI/CD tools for continuous integration and continuous deployment. It thus optimizes the development lifecycle—from code commit to production.

- **Multi-Language Support:**

It supports a variety of programming languages and frameworks; hence, it is versatile and flexible enough to operate under very different development environments.

- **Security:** Azure by default provides high level of security such as HTTPS, custom domain support, and integration with Azure Active Directory for authentication and authorization, it also supports managed certificates so that we can easily configure the SSL / TLS for our apps.
